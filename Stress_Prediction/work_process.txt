1. Data Preprocessing:
   - Data Cleaning (Handle missing values, duplicates, errors)
   - Feature Scaling/Normalization
   - Categorical Encoding (One-Hot, Label Encoding)
   - Handling Imbalanced Data (SMOTE, Class Weights) (No need cause overall_stress_level is balanced)
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
   - Univariate & Bivariate Analysis
   - Visualizations (Histograms, Boxplots, Heatmaps)
   - Statistical Testing (Pearson, Chi-Square)
3.Feature Engineering:
   - Feature Selection (RFE, Mutual Information, Feature Importance)
   - Feature Construction (Create new features)
4.*Model Selection:
   - Start with Simple Models (Logistic Regression, Decision Trees)
   - Move to Complex Models (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, SVM, KNN)
   - Neural Networks (for large datasets)
5. Model Evaluation:
   - Cross-Validation (K-Fold)
   - Evaluation Metrics (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, ROC-AUC for classification or MAE, MSE, RÂ² for regression)
   - Confusion Matrix (for classification)
6. Model Tuning:
   - Hyperparameter Tuning (GridSearchCV, RandomizedSearchCV)
   - Ensemble Methods (Bagging, Boosting, Stacking)
7. Overfitting & Underfitting:
   - Regularization (L1, L2)
   - Early Stopping (for Neural Networks)
   - Cross-Validation (to detect overfitting)
8. Model Deployment & Monitoring:
   - Deployment (e.g., Flask, Docker)
   - Model Monitoring (Track performance, retrain if needed)
9. Model Explainability:
   - Feature Importance
   - SHAP Values, LIME (for complex models)
